search [jql ...]
---------------------------------------
Conduct a search for issues on the remote Jira using the same Jira query language (JQL) as Jira uses for its own filters and searches.

Usage ...
---------
  > search project = abc
  Find all the issues in the 'ABC' project.

  > search assignee = fred.bloggs
  Find all the issues assigned to the Fred Bloggs user.

  > search type = epic and status = open
  Find all the open Epics.

Alias ...
---------
  > ?

Buckets ...
-----------
bucket[id] is a pseudofunction which is replaced with a comma-separated list of bucket keys, surrounded in braces, from the bucket whose id matches the string in [], before the JQL is sent to the remote server.

  > search key in bucket[0]
  Find all the issues whose keys correspond with those in bucket[0]. 

Variables ...
-----------
Any word in the JQL matching a variable name is substituted for the variable value before the JQL is sent.

  > search foo = bar
  This search would work if 'foo' was a variable whose value was 'project' and 'bar' was a variable whose value matched a project key on the remote Jira.
