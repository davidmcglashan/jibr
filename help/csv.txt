---------------------------------------
csv [fields ...]
---------------------------------------
Functionally equivalent to 'look' but displays its output as CSV instead of JSON. This is handy when using data with things like Excel.

The CSV format used here is quite crude. Any double-quote characters (") present in the data will be removed. Any commas (,) present in the data is escaped by wrapping the string in double-quotes. This feature isn't intended for lossless data transport, instead it should be considered a quick and dirty export feature.

Usage ...
---------
  > csv
  Displays the current payload in CSV format. Field selection is limited to the range defined by 'select'.

  > csv key summary assignee
  Displays the key, summary and assignee fields from the current payload in CSV format. Those fields must have been used in a prior select and therefore be already in the payload to be effective.
