echo (on|off|[level])

Changes the output threshold for text being written to the console. Output can be suppressed or changed to provide different levels of detail.

 0 - Absolutely mute - nothing is printed
 1 - Minimal - only commands whose intent is to display (e.g. look, help) display something.
 2 - Normal - Some "commentary" is provided
 3 - Everything - Includes network chatter and debug.
