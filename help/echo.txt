-------------------------------------------
echo ( on|off|[level]]|file stop|append|([filename]) )
-------------------------------------------
Changes the output threshold for text being written to the console. Output can be suppressed or changed to provide different levels of detail.

There are four levels ...
 0 - Absolutely mute - nothing is printed
 1 - Minimal - only commands whose intent is to display (e.g. look, help) display something.
 2 - Normal - Some "commentary" is provided
 3 - Everything - Includes network chatter and debug.

Echo output can be sent to a file instead of the console. The chosen file can be overwritten or appended to using the append flag in the command.

Usage ...
---------
  > echo
  Reports the current level as a number

  > echo [level]
  Sets the current level to [level]

  > echo on
  Sets the current level to 2

  > echo off
  Sets the current level to 1

  > echo file foo.txt
  Subsequent echoes are written to foo.txt

  > echo file append foo.txt
  Subsequent echoes are appended to the bottom of foo.txt, preserving the file's current contents.

  > echo file stop
  Echoes are sent to the console and no longer to an open file.
