script [file] ([params ...])
---------------------------------------
Open a text file and treat its line as instructions, executing them one after the other. Files are loaded from the current path. You can use / to change folders. The executed file should have a .jibr extension but you don't need to use this with the script command.

Parameters can be passed into the file. These must be declared in the first line of the script like so ...

  params abc def ghi

and the referenced in the commands that follow ...

  ? project = {abc}

Declared parameters must be used at the command line and they must be present in the script.

Usage ...
---------
  > script [file]
  Executes the instructions in [file]

  > script foo bar
  Executes the instructions in foo.jibr, passing in 'bar' as a parameter for use in the file.
