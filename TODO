scripts with params
- script foo bar pip
- runs script foo with params bar and pip in {1} and {2}
- need precheck that {1} and {2} exist
- use variables!

vars
- using in open
- using in bucket match 'bucket match <var> <bucket id>'
- find other places to use

buckets
- bucket match <term> <var> - match exactly <term> can put the bucket id in <var>
- bucket payload <id> - turn the bucket into the payload - short hand for '? key in bucket[id]'

issue
- issue <key> - displays a single record based on jbselect columns

buckets
- improvements to match
- bucket by 'field field field'
- bk <id> - <id> subtract one bucket from another (not numbered unless empty buckets handle gracefully)

count
- having > 50
- count into bucket
- order by count asc/desc
- order by field asc/desc

payloads
- payload [key] - show just the payload for that record
- append with ?
- jira payload - open the payload's keys in a search: key in ()

arrays and vars
- setting from payload
- viewing

keys command to pull keys out of payloads
- why?

things to do
- empty epics
- open epics with all closed stories
- running filters
- managing filters
- parser to turn 'ins' into a list of strings where " has joined multiple words together, etc.
